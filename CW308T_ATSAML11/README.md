## Power Supply

The core of the SAML11 chip runs from a 1.2v supply. This is supplied
through the CW308T 1.2v regulator. The I/O busses are supplied with
3.3v.

## Security Features

The SAML11 platform integrates many advanced security features
including:

  - Up to four tamper pins for static and dynamic intrusion detections
  - Silent flash access for side channel attack resistance
  - Data scrambling with user-defined keys for both Flash and RAM
  - A True Random Number Generator

Since it's a Cortex-M23 core, it's also got Arm TrustZone-M.

For a full list of security features see the product family data
sheet\[1\]

## Programming

The SAML10/11 family implements a serial bootloader. Usage of this
bootloader is not detailed in the data sheet, for usage information see
Microchip Application note AN2699\[2\]. This bootloader doesn't have a
driver in ChipWhisperer, but one could be added.

Serial Wire Debug (SWD) is also supported for programming and debugging
applications.
