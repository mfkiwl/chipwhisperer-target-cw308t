# CW308T-EFR32MG21

The EFR32MG21A board features the EFR32MG21A010F1024 from Silicon Labs. This device features a number of security features, including a dedicated “Secure Element” core that performs a secure boot operation, and DPA countermeasures on cryptographic primitives.

The RF section is not broken out to a 50-ohm matched header, but instead a simple 3-pin header which allows potential usage in laboratory environments.

See the -SOCKET board for an optional socket version.
See the -MG21B board for the version wtih ‘Secure Vault’.

## Security Features

EFR32MG21A (“Mighty Gecko Multiprotocol Wireless SoC”) has a high-performance Cortex M33 (TrustZone-M) with  a seperate “secure element” core that handles the secure boot operation, along with multiple cryptographic accelerators (both AES and ECC) that include advertised DPA countermeasures.

---

## Programming

A JTAG programmer is typically required for these devices.
